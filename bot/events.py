            Welcome to the server, {member.mention}!

            This server was created to alert friends and family when 
            matcha powder is restocked on a number of websites. With the 
            matcha shortage, I know it\'s been difficult to find and buy 
            matcha so hopefully this server can help!

            You can interact with the bot by using commands under the 
            "commands" button or by typing "/" in the chat. Commands may be 
            used in private messages with the bot or in any channel.

            You\'ll find the latest restocks in the #restock-alerts channel. 
            If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the #general channel 
            or DM Cheryl directly.

            Lastly, don\'t forget to enable push notifications for this 
            server so you don\'t miss the alerts!
